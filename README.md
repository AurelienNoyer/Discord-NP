# Discord Now Playing

This is a simple script that leverages [Net::Discord](https://github.com/vsTerminus/Net-Discord) and Net::LastFM to fill your Discord "Playing" status with Now Playing info from your Last.FM account instead!

Copy or rename config.ini.example to config.ini and then follow the instructions inside to fill it in.
Then run the script when you're done.
